                <div>
                    <p>Are you packing a school lunch for a picky eater? Getting your child to eat healthfully is a
                        struggle
                        for many parents. In this slideshow, Johns Hopkins pediatric dietitian Meredith Thivierge offers
                        school lunch tips for picky eaters to help you prepare meals with the vitamins, minerals and
                        nutrients your child needs to grow and succeed in school.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="../../../images/blog_content-1.png" alt="">
                <div>
                    <h1>The Royal Dine</h1>
                    <p>Children, especially younger children, can be influenced by how the food looks. Fun shapes and
                        bright
                        colors may grab their attention and encourage them to take a bite. You don’t have to spend a lot
                        of
                        time carving cartoon characters out of bologna. Just take a few minutes to arrange the lunch
                        neatly,
                        add a personal note or use a cookie cutter to shape a sandwich or slice of cheese to add visual
                        interest to the meal. “If the food looks fun and appetizing to you, there is a good chance your
                        picky eater will also find it appetizing,” Thivierge says.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="../../../images/blog_content-2.png" alt="">

                <div>
                    <h1>The Dish Express</h1>
                    <p>You may have to get creative to make sure your picky eater’s lunch covers the five major food
                        groups:
                        fruits, vegetables, protein, grains and dairy. If your child is allergic to or intolerant of
                        specific foods, it may be worth talking to your pediatrician about a multivitamin or supplement.
                        If
                        dietary restrictions are not an issue, you can try sneaking in foods your picky eater refuses to
                        eat. “Blending cauliflower with mashed potatoes or adding spinach to a fruit smoothie are a few
                        ways
                        parents can trick their children into eating healthy foods,” Thivierge suggests. She also
                        advises
                        asking your child why they dislike certain foods. If they simply don’t like the texture or look,
                        this can sometimes be remedied by trying different cooking techniques.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="../../../images/blog_content-3.png" alt="">

                <div>
                    <h1>The Nawab Kitchen</h1>
                    <p>CPicky eaters, and children in general, are more likely to eat something if they helped to make
                        it.
                        Participation gives kids a sense of ownership in the final product and helps them see exactly
                        what’s
                        inside that sandwich or salad they are having for lunch. You can involve your children at every
                        stage of the process, from picking a recipe to food shopping and meal preparation. “Together you
                        could create a list of foods your children enjoy and that you approve of and then have them
                        choose
                        from this list,” recommends Thivierge. This allows parents to remain in control while giving a
                        child
                        the freedom of choice.</p>
